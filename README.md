# a-synchronous-swim
This is a project to learn about asynchronous behaviors through the use of keyboard events and network events. I constructed both client and server systems (with NodeJS) to interact with each other.

I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
